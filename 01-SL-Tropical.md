# SL - Tropical

## Strophe 1

Let me sip on my tropical juice

And let me smoke this tropical weed

B, I got the maddest of flavours

Don't think that this shit comes cheap

## Strophe 2

So bitch don't moan

When I charge 15 for a D

Just a little nigga in his zone

Grind hard can't slow on these streets

## Strophe 3

Mismatch and I'm doing it all

Dip, splash and I'm getting him peak

Huh? I'm in the field all day

No time for these stupid neeks

## Strophe 4

Come, bitch come my way

Just watch how a veteran speaks

Tooled up on the lurk for my prey

The waigons don't want me to eat

Man, the hood's all mad

## Strophe 5

I wish I could just make my P

But these bitches on me, so you know I can't

lack

The jake boys really on my back

Got me in and out of court, got me feeling a

twat

And it's all my fault, 'cuh I'm always

getting caught

## Strophe 6

Like, I'm better than that

The feds got like ten of the gang

Free R1, free Max, free Taz

Rest in peace all my brothers

## Strophe 7

RIP Jetz, RIP T Bandz

I buil' a sweet one with a mean kickback

When I think about my bros

Gorgeous thing, amazing round

## Strophe 8

Smiles when the pack came in

Now we gotta break this down

In and out with a gorgeous thing

That was an amazing round

What she do with that shit?

## Strophe 9

I didn't even make a sound

Couple draw outs came in

Now we gotta take them out

Don't slip, don't slip

'Cuh my niggas got it no doubt

## Strophe 10

Stay stocked up, real shit

The plug don't see no drought

Bro said he got a move

Cool, show me the ins and outs

Said quick, we're in and we're out

If he's giving it up, then we're putting him

down

## Strophe 11

Real trap nigga

I'm grabbing them packs, and I push it around

If the line goes stiff, then I'm hitting the 

strip

And I perk it in town

Said he got bits of the loud

## Strophe 12

What bits of the loud? Bro ring right now

I'm tryna make a killing right now

Fuck that bitch, I ain't with it right now

Why this bitch wanna grab on my jumper?

I thought I was a one hit wonder?

## Strophe 13

Now she calling me a one hit wonder

I hit that once and where I went, gee, I 

wonder!

Real anti social fucker

Moan 'bout these blunt replies

Well, these replies only gonna get blunter

## Strophe 14

Other side with some fantasy knives

Shit, you don't really wanna buck this cutter

I love going round on a gorgeous glide

Tryna see a gorgeous number

## Strophe 15

My mum don't like how I play with knives

Well, I'm real sorry mother

But I won't have no joke boy take my life

So, for now I gotta stay with my other

## Strophe 16

Smiles when the pack came in

Now we gotta break this down

In and out with a gorgeous thing

That was an amazing round

What she do with that shit?

## Strophe 17

## Strophe 18
