Let me sip on my tropical juice
And let me smoke this tropical weed
B, I got the maddest of flavours
Don't think that this shit comes cheap
So bitch don't moan
When I charge 15 for a D
Just a little nigga in his zone
Grind hard can't slow on these streets
Mismatch and I'm doing it all
Dip, splash and I'm getting him peak
Huh? I'm in the field all day
No time for these stupid neeks
Come, bitch come my way
Just watch how a veteran speaks
Tooled up on the lurk for my prey
The waigons don't want me to eat
Man, the hood's all mad
I wish I could just make my P
But these bitches on me, so you know I can't lack
The jake boys really on my back
Got me in and out of court, got me feeling a twat
And it's all my fault, 'cuh I'm always getting caught
Like, I'm better than that
The feds got like ten of the gang
Free R1, free Max, free Taz
Rest in peace all my brothers
RIP Jetz, RIP T Bandz
I buil' a sweet one with a mean kickback
When I think about my bros
Gorgeous thing, amazing round
Smiles when the pack came in
Now we gotta break this down
In and out with a gorgeous thing
That was an amazing round
What she do with that shit?
I didn't even make a sound
Couple draw outs came in
Now we gotta take them out
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cuh my niggas got it no doubt
Stay stocked up, real shit
The plug don't see no drought
Bro said he got a move
Cool, show me the ins and outs
Said quick, we're in and we're out
If he's giving it up, then we're putting him down
Real trap nigga
I'm grabbing them packs, and I push it around
If the line goes stiff, then I'm hitting the strip
And I perk it in town
Said he got bits of the loud
What bits of the loud? Bro ring right now
I'm tryna make a killing right now
Fuck that bitch, I ain't with it right now
Why this bitch wanna grab on my jumper?
I thought I was a one hit wonder?
Now she calling me a one hit wonder
I hit that once and where I went, gee, I wonder!
Real anti social fucker
Moan 'bout these blunt replies
Well, these replies only gonna get blunter
Other side with some fantasy knives
Shit, you don't really wanna buck this cutter
I love going round on a gorgeous glide
Tryna see a gorgeous number
My mum don't like how I play with knives
Well, I'm real sorry mother
But I won't have no joke boy take my life
So, for now I gotta stay with my other
Smiles when the pack came in
Now we gotta break this down
In and out with a gorgeous thing
That was an amazing round
What she do with that shit?
I didn't even make a sound
Couple draw outs came in
Now we gotta take them out
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cuh my niggas got it no doubt
Stay stocked up, real shit
The plug don't see no drought
Bro said he got a move
Cool, show me the ins and outs
Said quick, we're in and we're out
If he's giving it up, then we're putting him down
